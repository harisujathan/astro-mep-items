2. a) run . ./a linus.txt>b ("b" file is picked up by next program).
b) run java nav4 [mep-degree-fraction] [mep-item-planet-degree] [mep-item-planet-minute] [[planet-filter] [display-header] [all-or-noAll-switch]]
eg: java nav4 0.8 13 20 0 t all - will display all MEP items (moon 13 20 is ignored)
java nav4 0.5 24 0 - will display all venus MEP items with header.
java nav4 0.8 18 0 Jup - will display all mercury MEP items with Jup filter with header
java nav4 0.5 36 0 Sun 0 - will display mars MEP items with header omitted
java nav4 0.8 45 0 ah - Jupiter items with rahu filter (here "ah" is used for "rahu" due to some export error)
java nav4 0.9 72 0 Moo - saturn mep items with moon filter.


3. CODE IS TRIAL STAGE, MANY CODE HAS TO BE REMOVED. THERE IS TRIAL HOUSE ADDED FOR EACH ROW FOR 13-20 MEP ITEM FOR NOT ALL. PLEASE ADD MORE FOR ALL IF NEEDED TO GREP A LOT. copyright Hari Sujathan 2018-2020.

4. Idea of MEP items was conceived in 2018. nakshatra MEP item was first breakthough, followed by trials by extending concept for all 9 planets. D99 CONCEPT WAS FOUND IN 2020 MAY AND IS HIGHLY VALID( IF NAVAMSA IS SOUL, WHY NOT PARAMATMA BE NAVAMSA'S NAVAMSA). USE SARAVALI VOL1 AND VOL2 ALONG WITH THIS TO VALIDATE ALL MEP ITEMS TO UNDERSTAND PLANETARY FORCES SPLITUP WORKING IN YOUR LIFE.
